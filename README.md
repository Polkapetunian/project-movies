# Project Movies

This week's project was to create a site displaying data from the movie database themoviedb.org. We chose to use an API endpoint that displays the movies that are toprated in Sweden. 

## The problem

The site consists of two pages and a few components. In React we used React Router components BrowserRouter, Link, Route and Switch to control how the pages are shown and what URL:s that lead to them. We also used useEffect hooks to control when the data is fetched from the API and useState hooks to store the fetched data.  
 
We didn't encounter that many technical issues, only that we weren't really sure where to fetch the different API endpoints from start.  

If we had more time we would add a ‘not found’ page and style the loading page.
